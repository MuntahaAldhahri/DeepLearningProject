# DeepLearningProject


The primary objective of the project is to leverage deep learning tools, such as (Python, Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow) for the purpose of analyzing large datasets using deep learning models.

Our team has identified a dataset about jellyfish on Kaggle, which can be accessed through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/jellyfish-types

We have chosen to utilize deep learning techniques to categorize jellyfish images into distinct classes and to identify the species of jellyfish based on their physical attributes.
